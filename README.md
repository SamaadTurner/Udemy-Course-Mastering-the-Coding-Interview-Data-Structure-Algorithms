# What I did:

## Day 1:

### Key takeaways
- Talked about all the things non technical that is considered in the interview. Those things are resume, github, and things pertaining to that. I need to do some more open-source contributions (ZTM has a section that has many projects where I can do that).
- I have done many thiings from the bootcamp that this course is saying that I should do like create a website (use the mashup-template)(look at github).
- Add LaLa Photobooth to my resume as job history and also add it as a project on my resume. For the job history, talk about how long it took and the deadlines i had to make
- Best way to get hired: referals (networking).

- Resource: email template 
- | Hey $BOB,
    I saw your presentation at $CONFERENCE last year on Youtube (rr point to some work they have done).
    Great stuff; loved what you did with $FOO, in particular
    $COMMENT_PROVING_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_YOU'RE_TALKING_ABOUT.
    I'm also a $FOO developer. I noticed that your company is hiring
    or $ROLE. Iâ€™d love to be a part of your team. Do you have a
    few minutes to chat on Thursday about what you guys are doing?
    
    Thanks,
    Yourname
    Your website or any public profile link

- APPLY TO JOBS WHERE THE DESCRIPTIONS SHOW TOOLS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN. YOU WILL GROW AT THAT JOB!.

## Day 2:

### Key takeaways

- Big O Notation: Tells you how well (how fast) a problem is solved.
- (navigate to bigO folder to see the exercises)
- Rules for Big O notation:
- Rule 1: Worse Case  
- Rule 2: Remove Constants
- Rule 3: Different terms for inputs
- Rule 4: Drop Non Dominants

### Day 3:
- Finished up Big O

### Day 4:
- What causes space complexity? -
- Variables
- Data Structures
- Function Call
- Allocations

If I get asked what time complexity of a built in method is, the answer is that it "Depends on the language you are using the built in method in".

BIG O section summary:

- Big O is used to describe how efficient we can run our code (which saves companies money)
- When it comes to 'Good code' we are concern with readability and scalability. Big O allows us to measure scalability.
- Knowing how long your code takes to run and how much memory it takes is very important.
- Time complexity: How long it takes your code to run
- Space complexity: The memory that is required by the code

#### What are companies looking for?
1. Analytic Skills: How can you think through a problem and analyze them 
2. Coding Skills: Do you code well? Is it clean and readable?
3. Technical Skills: Do you know the fundamentals?  
4. Communication Skills: Can you communicate well with other people? Do you fit?

#### Technical Interview Section
- The key in this section is the cheat sheet (provided by the course). Write everything out! Go step by step.

### Day 5: Data Structures + Algorithms

- Start of Data Structures and Algorithms:
- What is a data structure? A way of arranging and storing data (numbers, strings, booleans, etc.) to make it easier to use in computer programs.
- Examples: Arrays, linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, Heaps, etc.
- What is an Algorithm? An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions for solving a specific problem or performing a task.
- Examples: Sorting, Dynamic Programming, Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Recursion, etc.

#### Arrays:
- organizes items sequentially in memory.
- ex: const strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
- Methods we have that are built in for arrays:
- .push: strings.push('e'); --> adds 'e' to the end of the array. In O(1)
- .pop: strings.pop(); --> removes last item from array. In O{1}.
- strings.unshift('x') --> adds 'x' at the BEGINNING of our array. In O(n)
- .splice: strings.splice(starting index, 0, 'what you add') --> adds string to middle of array. In O(n)

#### Arrays: Static vs Dynamic

- Static is fixed size.
- Dynamic allow us to copy and rebuilt an array at a new location (xpands as you add more elements).

#### Classes in JS

3 important things with objects:
- reference type:
Primitive types are defined by JS.
Reference types are created by me, the programmer.

- context:
Tells you where you are within the object.
'this' refers to what object its inside of.

- instantiation: making copies of an object:
class Player {
    // every time i make a Player copy, it will have a name and type property (i give whatever name or player I want). It will also have the introduce() method. THIS IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR A Player.
    constructor(name, type){
        this.name = name;
        this.type = name;
    }
    introudct(){
        // when you want to access a property within the constructor, you must use the keyword 'this'.
        console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name}, I'm a ${this.type}`);
    }
}

Here is another example:


class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  introduce() {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Alice', 25);
const person2 = new Person('Bob', 30);

person1.introduce(); // Outputs: Hi, I'm Alice and I'm 25 years old.
person2.introduce(); // Outputs: Hi, I'm Bob and I'm 30 years old.


notes:

- We have a Person class with a constructor that initializes the name and age properties.
- The introduce method is used to log a message introducing the person, utilizing the name and age properties.
- Two instances of the Person class (person1 and person2) are created with different data.
- When calling the introduce method on each instance, it correctly outputs the introduction for each person.
- This example demonstrates how classes and the this keyword can be used to model real-world entities with shared behavior (methods) and individual characteristics (properties). Each instance of the class represents a specific person with its own set of data.


* With all that said, lets say i want to create a 'SPECIAL' person that  has all the qualities of the Person class AND then some special qualities. We need to EXTEND the Person class.
* ANY TIME WE EXTEND, WE NEED TO CALL THE CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION FROM THE CLASS YOU ARE EXTENDING AND PASS THE CONSTRUCTOR PROPERTIES FOR THAT CLASS (IN THIS CASE, IT IS THE Player class). USE THE 'SUPER' KEYWORD.

ex:

class SpecialPerson extends Player {
    constructor (name, type){
        super(name, type)
    }
    // new stuff for this special player
    play(){
        console.log(`WEEEEEEEEEE, I'm a ${this.type}`);   
    }
}

// creating wizard players
const wizard1 = new Wizard('Sam', 'Dark Magic');
const wizard2 = new Wizard('Jocelyn', 'Healer');
